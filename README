Description
-----------

sz81 is a Sinclair ZX80/ZX81 emulator very much based upon the work of
Ian Collier's xz80 and Russell Marks's z81 but employing the highly
portable SDL and including additional functionality and features for
desktop computers and portable devices.

Features:
 * Virtual keyboard with adjustable opacity, autohide on newline,
   sticky shift or toggle shift
 * Control bar with access to several regularly used options
 * The ability to run centred within any resolution
 * Runtime switchable scaling up to 3x on supported platforms
 * Toggling between a window and fullscreen on supported platforms
 * Support for portrait orientated screens such as 240x320 and 480x640
 * User-definable (actually currently developer-definable) keys
 * Joystick to keyboard remapping (joystick navigation is to follow)
 * Maximum porting potential since it only requires SDL

To-Do:
 * Virtual keyboard navigation and activation using a joystick
 * Key repeating within the GUI
 * OSS to SDL API sound conversion


Controls
--------

For the PC:

    Click screen - Toggle virtual keyboard and control bar
    Backspace    - Rubout i.e. equivalent to CTRL or SHIFT + 0
    Comma        - Equivalent to using CTRL or SHIFT + .
    Cursors      - Equivalent to using CTRL or SHIFT + 5, 6, 7 and 8
    ALT + R      - Cycle between 960x720, 640x480 and 320x240
    F11          - Toggle between fullscreen and a window

    Clicking the screen (or F1) brings up the virtual keyboard and the
    control bar giving access to several very useful options. These
    are listed below alongside their keyboard equivalents :-

    Exit          - Exit emulator (F10)
    Reset         - Reset emulator (F12)
    Autohide      - Toggle vkeyb between autohide and don't hide (F6)
    Shift Type    - Toggle between sticky shift and toggle shift (F7)
    Invert Screen - Toggle between not inverse and inverse video (F8)
    Opacity DN/UP - Reduce (HOME) or increase (END) vkeyb opacity

    To access the file selector type "J", SHIFT + "P" twice and ENTER
    from within the emulator.

For the Sharp Zaurus:

    Click screen - Toggle virtual keyboard and control bar
    Backspace    - Rubout i.e. equivalent to CTRL or SHIFT + 0
    Comma        - Equivalent to using CTRL or SHIFT + .
    Cursors      - Equivalent to using CTRL or SHIFT + 5, 6, 7 and 8

    To access the file selector type "J", SHIFT + "P" twice and ENTER
    from within the emulator.

For the GPH GP2X:

    Since by default the GP2X is controlled via a digital joystick and
    buttons, the joystick controls have been mapped so that the user
    can load and play the aydemo.p music demo and the mine81.p mines
    game only. This build demonstrates the framework that has been
    provided by this SDL port rather than suggesting that it is
    currently in any way generally usable on such a device.
    
    Select       - Toggle virtual keyboard and control bar
    Start        - Exit emulator
    Joy Up       - K
    Joy Right    - L
    Joy Down     - J
    Joy Left     - H
    LTrigger     - Q
    RTrigger     - A
    Button Y     - Space
    Button B     - Enter
    Button A     - 1
    Volume Down  - 2
    Button X     - 3
    Volume Up    - 4
    Joy Push     - 5

    The GP2X build boots straight into the file selector and has the
    screen colours inverted by default (see sz81.gpe).


Installation
------------

To function correctly sz81 expects to find the zx80.rom and zx81.rom
ROMs which are not included within this source package. You might find
them at ftp://ftp.nvg.ntnu.no/pub/sinclair/roms, or perhaps through
searching the internet for "zx80.rom" and "zx81.rom".

Extract the sz81 source package, copy the zx80.rom and zx81.rom ROMs
into the data folder and change into the extracted directory.

For the PC:

    Comment/uncomment the PREFIX BINDIR XBINDIR MANDIR LIBDIR group
    half-way down the Makefile depending on whether you want to do a
    system-wide install or run from the source folder (default), and
    then type :-

    make clean
    make
    (If you're running from the source folder then that's it, but if
    installing system-wide then login as root now and continue)
    make install

For the Sharp Zaurus (requires SDK):

    make clean
    make -f Makefile.zaurus

    Copy the following files to a folder on your Zaurus, for example
    /home/zaurus/sz81 :-

    sz81
    data

    and some or all of the p files from games-etc and execute sz81
    from the terminal.

For the GPH GP2X (requires SDK):

    make clean
    make -f Makefile.gp2x

    Copy the following files to a folder on your SD card :-

    sz81 and sz81.gpe
    data

    and mine81.p and aydemo.p from games-etc and execute sz81.gpe
    from the GP2X GUI. If you require an icon for gmenu2x then you
    can use the supplied sz81.png.
