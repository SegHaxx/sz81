Description
-----------

sz81 is a Sinclair ZX80/ZX81 emulator very much based upon the work of
Ian Collier's xz80 and Russell Marks's z81 but employing the highly
portable SDL and including additional functionality and features for
desktop computers and portable devices.

Features:
 * Virtual keyboard with adjustable opacity, autohide on newline,
   sticky shift or toggle shift
 * Control bar with access to several regularly used options
 * Full mouse/stylus and joystick support throughout
 * The ability to run centred within any resolution
 * Runtime switchable scaling up to 3x on supported platforms
 * Toggling between a window and fullscreen on supported platforms
 * Support for portrait orientated screens such as 240x320 and 480x640
 * Maximum porting potential since it only requires SDL

Immediate To-Do:
 * Loading of remapped controls from an rcfile
 * Runtime joystick button remapping and saving to rcfile
 * OSS to SDL API sound conversion
For the Future:
 * Foreground and background colour chooser
 * Input macros
 * Program state saving and loading
Good Ideas:
 * Program text extraction to a selectable text bar for input line
   insertion (e.g. for text adventures)

Installation
------------

To function correctly sz81 expects to find the zx80.rom and zx81.rom
ROMs which are not included within this source package. You might find
them at ftp://ftp.nvg.ntnu.no/pub/sinclair/roms, or perhaps through
searching the internet for "zx80.rom" and "zx81.rom".

Extract the sz81 source package, copy the zx80.rom and zx81.rom ROMs
into the data folder and change into the extracted directory.

For the PC:

    Comment/uncomment the PREFIX BINDIR DOCDIR PACKAGE_DATA_DIR group
    at the top of the Makefile depending on whether you want to do a
    local install, system-wide install or run from the source folder
    (default) and then type :-

    make clean
    make
    (If you're running from the source folder then that's it, but if
    you're installing this locally or system-wide then continue)
    (Installing system-wide requires that you login as root now)
    make install

For the Sharp Zaurus (requires SDK):

    make clean
    make -f Makefile.zaurus

    Copy the following files to a folder on your Zaurus, for example
    /home/zaurus/sz81 :-

    sz81
    data

    and some or all of the p files from games-etc and execute sz81
    from the terminal.

For the GPH GP2X (requires SDK):

    make clean
    make -f Makefile.gp2x

    Copy the following files to a folder on your SD card :-

    sz81 and gp2x/sz81.gpe
    data

    and mine81.p and aydemo.p from games-etc and execute sz81.gpe
    from the GP2X GUI. If you require an icon for gmenu2x then you
    can use the supplied icon32.png.
