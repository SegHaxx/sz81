Notes for version 2.3.x:

* The rewritten zx81_do_scanlines() resets the HSYNC "207" counter with
  INT ACK, rather than VSYNC. This should remove the few artefacts seen
  with the rowcounter, and the check for tperscanline. Thanks to Andy Rea's
  and Grant Searle's detailed information on the internet.

* The WAIT hardware emulation should on average be close to the original,
  and is always active, as in the unmodified ZX81.

* The 24K and 56K memory options enables the memory region 8K to 16K for WRX.
  Otherwise, it initially contains copies of the ROM, but may be used, for
  example, for UDG.

Notes for version 2.3.5:

* The Unreal sound code may be enabled at the Sound Options screen;
  in this version sound is always ACB stereo.

Notes for version 2.3.4:

* A memory region to be disassembled while running may be specified with the
  "-Baddr" and "-Eaddr" command line options. If "-E" is missing, the region
  consists of one address given with the "-B" option. Addresses prefixed by "0x"
  are interpreted as hexadecimal. With the Z80 code, also the number of tstates
  within the frame, the address, and the contents of the AF, BC, DE, HL and SP
  registers are displayed. Example: with "sz81 -B0x695" the line numbers of the
  BASIC lines to be executed may be traced in the DE register.

Notes for version 2.3.2:

* Wilf Rigter's HS4 high speed interface (http://www.user.dccnet.com/wrigter/index_files/HS4.htm)
  may be emulated using the "-W" and "-R" command line options:

  - start the first instance of sz81 with "sz81 -W &"
  - and a next one with "sz81 -R hs4.p &"

  The first instance may next be set in FAST mode; the other instance(s)
  continue(s) showing the screen. The shared memory on the host system will remain
  active while the first instance is running.
