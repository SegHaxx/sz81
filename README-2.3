Notes for version 2.3.x:

* The rewritten zx81_do_scanlines() resets the HSYNC "207" counter with
  INT ACK, rather than VSYNC. This should remove the few artefacts seen
  with the rowcounter, and the check for tperscanline. Thanks to Andy Rea's
  and Grant Searle's detailed information on the internet.

* The WAIT hardware emulation should on average be close to the original,
  and is always active, as in the unmodified ZX81.

* The 24K and 56K memory options enables the memory region 8K to 16K for WRX.
  Otherwise, it initially contains copies of the ROM, but may be used, for
  example, for UDG.

Notes for version 2.3.12:
* sdl_loadsave.c gave a file list with improper entries when using LOAD ""
* Current optimization gives an unnecessary warning in zxpand/ff.cpp

Notes for version 2.3.11:
* Global variables rearranged to avoid "multiple definition" issues
* Improved VDRIVE emulation; add -DVDRIVE in Makefile

Notes for version 2.3.10:

* WIZnet W5100 emulation (for ZeddyNet) in w5100.c much improved.
* h4thz.rom (in data): H4TH with ZeddyNet possibilities: see h4thz.pdf
* zx81x2apu.rom (in data): Zsolt's Big Bang ROM with calls to the AM 9511 APU.

Notes for version 2.3.9:

* Some ZXpand support added. Most commands work. Memory model selection
  and disabling ZXpand do not yet work.
  The original ZXpand emulation sources are at https://sourceforge.net/projects/eightyone-sinclair-emulator/
  and were adapted to work under Linux and sz81.
* Add -DZXNU in the Makefile for partial ZXNU support.
  - A ROM with H4TH support is included (see ZX-TEAM forum).
  - Some messages appear in the console.
  - Also some partial VDRIVE support, enough to load H4TH programs.

Notes for version 2.3.8:

* Support has been added to enable/disable UDG CHAR16 support and WRX.
* WRX can now be enabled or disabled for any memory size >2k.
  - For a memory size of <=2k WRX is always on. This mimics the real hardware.

Notes for version 2.3.7:

* Some first ZXmore support is included (add -DZXMORE to the compile flags):
  - "ZXM-DATA.BIN" is expected to be in the "data" directory.
  - Possibly some sz81 settings and features interfere with ZXmore's operation
    and vice versa; the 56K memory option is required.
  - The "powered down" mode gives a horizontal shift with z88dk's hires programs.
  - No USB support, but files can be loaded/saved as usual, although not via the command line
  - ROM in an instance may be "flashed" for example with LOAD "NAME.ROM;#ADDRESS".
  - ZeddyNet support only in instance 1.
  - memory in the range 0x2000-0x4000 may be made shareable by adding -DZXMSHMEM
    (only ZXmaster version 1.7 is compatible with this mode).
* "50 notes music interface" by Gaetano Marano added (implementation by Stefano Bodrato)
   (add -DFNMI to the compile flags to enable it).
* Some SP012 support
* LOAD and STORE for H4TH. Configure sz81 to use 24K and without M1NOT support.
  The ROM may be loaded with LOAD "h4th.rom;0" or by copying the ROM over the
  zx81.rom file in the "data" directory, but then the command line options "-L -S"
  are needed.

Notes for version 2.3.5:

* The Unreal sound code may be enabled at the Sound Options screen;
  in this version sound is always ACB stereo.

Notes for version 2.3.4:

* A memory region to be disassembled while running may be specified with the
  "-Baddr" and "-Eaddr" command line options. If "-E" is missing, the region
  consists of one address given with the "-B" option. Addresses prefixed by "0x"
  are interpreted as hexadecimal. With the Z80 code, also the number of tstates
  within the frame, the address, and the contents of the AF, BC, DE, HL and SP
  registers are displayed. Example: with "sz81 -B0x695" the line numbers of the
  BASIC lines to be executed may be traced in the DE register.

Notes for version 2.3.2:

* Wilf Rigter's HS4 high speed interface (http://www.user.dccnet.com/wrigter/index_files/HS4.htm)
  may be emulated using the "-W" and "-R" command line options:

  - start the first instance of sz81 with "sz81 -W &"
  - and a next one with "sz81 -R hs4.p &"

  The first instance may next be set in FAST mode; the other instance(s)
  continue(s) showing the screen. The shared memory on the host system will remain
  active while the first instance is running.
