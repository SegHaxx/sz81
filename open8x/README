open80.asm
==========

open80.asm is the Open80 ROM, a GNU GPL version of the ZX80 ROM.
Since no original source code exists, this was recreated for the sz81
project by disassembling the binary to satisfy the GNU GPL.

Assembling
----------

Firstly you'll need to install the Pasmo Z80 cross-assembler.

    http://www.arrakis.es/~ninsesabe/pasmo/

Execute "make open80" from the root of the source package to initiate
the following:

 * open8x/open80.asm is assembled to open8x/open80.rom
 * open8x/open80.rom is copied to data/zx80.rom IF data/zx80.rom is
   not found to exist.

The ROMs need to be maintained in the data folder for the emulator to
function, but they won't be overwritten if they're already there.


open81.asm
==========

open81.asm is the Open81 ROM, a GNU GPL version of the "improved" ZX81
ROM. For more details visit https://sites.google.com/site/open81rom/


Assembling
----------

The process is identical to the one explained above except you should
type "make open81" to build the open81.rom / maintain data/zx81.rom
