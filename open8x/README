Assembling
==========

Firstly you'll need to install the Pasmo Z80 cross-assembler.

    http://www.arrakis.es/~ninsesabe/pasmo/

Then execute "make" or "make open81" from the root of the source package
to initiate the following:

 * open8x/open81.asm is assembled to open8x/open81.rom
 * If data/zx81.rom is not found to exist then open8x/open81.rom is
   copied to data/zx81.rom.
