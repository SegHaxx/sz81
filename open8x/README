open80.asm
==========

open80.asm is the Open80 ROM, a GNU GPL version of the ZX80 ROM.
Since no original source code exists, this was recreated for the sz81
project by disassembling the binary to satisfy the GNU GPL.

open81.asm
==========

open81.asm is the Open81 ROM, a GNU GPL version of the "improved" ZX81
ROM. For more details visit https://sites.google.com/site/open81rom/


Assembling
==========

Firstly you'll need to install the Pasmo Z80 cross-assembler.

    http://www.arrakis.es/~ninsesabe/pasmo/

Then execute "make" from the root of the source package to initiate the
following:

 * open8x/open80.asm is assembled to open8x/open80.rom
 * open8x/open80.rom is copied to data/zx80.rom IF data/zx80.rom is
   not found to exist.
 * open8x/open81.asm is assembled to open8x/open81.rom
 * open8x/open81.rom is copied to data/zx81.rom IF data/zx81.rom is
   not found to exist.
 
The ROMs need to be maintained in the data folder for the emulator to
function, but they won't be overwritten if they're already there.

It is also possible to type "make open80" or "make open81" if you want
to build the ROMs independently.
