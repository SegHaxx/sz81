* Reworked the control remapping feature. Now a device can be
  remapped to any other device including a virtual cursor device, and
  be tied to a particular component such as the load selector.
* Added joystick support throughout. Joystick controls are currently
  hardcoded control remappings awaiting transferral to an rcfile.
