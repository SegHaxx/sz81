Please see NEWS for a summary of changes since the last release suitable
for announcements.

2011-02-13 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Version 2.1.7 released (r202)

2011-02-10 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added a dynamic modal dialog.
* Added an exit dialog to confirm writing to sz81rc.
* Added Win32 support via the _WIN32 preprocessor macro.

2011-02-03 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added dragging ability to hotspots via SDL_DRAGGED state (very easy).
* Added a ZX style scrollbar to the load file dialog for mouse control.

2011-01-30 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added pausing the emulator via Pause (SDLK_PAUSE). For platforms that
  don't have a Pause key, adding a ctrl_remap to sz81rc that remaps
  an input control to SDLK_PAUSE will enable access to this feature.
  The load/save state dialogs place the emulator on hold in any case.

2011-01-30 Chris Young <chris_at_unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk>
* OS4 sz81 LOAD/SAVE now follows the last used directory.  Set tooltype
  STATICLOADDIR to revert to previous behaviour.

2011-01-29 Chris Young <chris_at_unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk>
* Create a useful program dir in LOCAL_DATA_DIR, and make the Amiga
  version use it by default for all loads and saves.

2011-01-28 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added saving screenshots via PrtScn (SDLK_PRINT). For platforms that
  don't have a PrtScn key, adding a ctrl_remap to sz81rc that remaps
  an input control to SDLK_PRINT will enable access to this feature.

2011-01-27 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added save state and load state icons to the control bar.

2011-01-26 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added a save state system (F4/F5) although awaiting integration into
  the control bar.

2011-01-16 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Replaced z81's save_p: ZX80 files can now be named by default as date
  and time stamped or extracted from a xxxx REM SAVE "progname" line.

2011-01-14 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added forced (non-LOAD) program loading via the load file dialog.
* Replaced z81's machine reset method with a thorough emulator reset.

2011-01-13 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added support for ZX80 LOAD and ZX81 LOAD "" loading of o/80/p/81 
  files via a new load file dialog.

2011-01-11 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Auto-loading of 80 and 81 files is implemented as o and p.
* The ZX81's LOAD "progname" will now open a file as lower or uppercase
  within the directory currently set within the load file dialog.

2011-01-10 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Modified supported RAM sizes: it's now 1 to 4K, 16, 32, 48 and 56K.
* Auto-loading of ZX80 o and ZX81 p files is now implemented for all
  RAM configurations.

2011-01-07 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added support for the mouse wheel: remapped as keyboard cursor keys.

2010-12-20 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added show_input_id to the rcfile (was a CLI option).
* Implemented variable emulation speed but I haven't yet managed to
  iron out the problems with slowing down and speeding up the sound
  (if at all I can) so I've disabled the code for the time being.

2010-12-18 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added sound device selection to the runtime options.
* Added sound device to the rcfile.

2010-12-15 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added frameskip adjustment to the runtime options.
* Added frameskip to the rcfile.

2010-12-14 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added RAM size changing to the runtime options.
* Added RAM size to the rcfile.

2010-12-13 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added vkeyb autohide, toggle_shift and alpha to the rcfile.
* Added invert screen to the rcfile.

2010-12-12 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added machine model switching to the runtime options.
* Added machine model to the rcfile.

2010-12-08 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added support for (in addition to z81's 1K to 16K) 32K, 48K and 56K of
  RAM. load_p now loads up to 48K instead of z81's 16K limit.

2010-12-07 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added support for a thorough runtime reinitialisation of z81 (sz81
  was tweaked a little). RAM and ROM changes have been tested to work.

2010-12-06 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added a function to preload the ROMs which will enable the emulator
  to switch between them at runtime without repeatedly loading them.
* Modified vkeyb_init to load both keyboard images on initialisation.

2010-12-05 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added two runtime options pages and moved the original two.
* Modified the ZX printer filename to include the date and time.

2010-12-04 Chris Young <chris_at_unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk>
* Updated Amiga sections to reflect recent changes.
* Modified ZX printer so the output file is not opened until something
  is printed.

2010-12-02 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Removed most of the command-line interface leaving only the video
  options. sz81 now manages the CLI which makes parseoptions redundant.
* Added support for a platform dependent local data directory which is
  currently used to locate the permanently operational ZX printer file.
* Completely reorganised main in smain.c. Since configuring sz81 via
  the CLI is now redundant, sz81 is initialised before the emulator so
  that the emulator will now initialise using rcfile data.

2010-11-25 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added support for assembling pipepanic and mctemplate using Pasmo.
* Added ZX80 ROM source code recreated from disassembling the binary.

2010-11-24 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Conventionalised and tweaked the build system a little more.
* Reorganised the newly added Open81 content in preparation for the
  soon to be included Open80 content.

2010-07-15 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Both the mctemplate and PipePanic game are complete.

2010-05-11 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added a ZX81 machine code template and a pipe connecting game which
  is still under development.

2010-05-06 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Tweaked GPH GP2X Wiz support.

2010-05-04 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added support for the GPH GP2X Wiz.

2010-04-30 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Changed the way sdl_rcfile_read() manages reading ctrl_remaps: If one
  or more ctrl_remaps were read then they will completely replace the
  existing default ctrl_remaps, and if none were read then the defaults
  will remain.

2010-04-28 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added fullscreen, xres and yres command line options.
* Added keyboard page up and page down to the load selector.

2010-04-27 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Version 2.1.6.1 released
* Fixed a few issues with the joystick configurator.

2010-04-26 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Version 2.1.6 released
* Added an alternative keyboard based control remapper (F9) for users
  with single buttoned joysticks.

2010-04-25 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* The joystick configurator and runtime options are now complete.

2010-04-19 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Fixed a z81 bug in common.c:load_selector() whereby the parent dir
  wasn't always returned by readdir() which would result in the load
  selector not finding any suitable files in a folder and closing
  prematurely, and also becoming stuck in a folder with no way out.
  I experienced this on my Sharp Zaurus.
* Tweaked the selector navigation within runopts and added joystick
  LTrig/RTrig pageup and pagedown control remappings to the load
  selector (I've already added them to runopts).

2010-04-18 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Excluding the configurator, both runtime options pages are now fully
  functional and navigable using the keyboard (cursors and enter),
  mouse or joystick. The control remappings have been significantly
  updated and so any existing rcfile will have to be deleted; later
  I'll check for an old rcfile in code and ignore it.

2010-04-17 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added a message box manager which is currently used when saving from
  runopts or changing the volume (default -/= or use mouse in runopts).

2010-04-16 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Runtime options now works i.e. the changes are saved or discarded.
  The joystick configurator and selector navigation will be implemented
  later when I'm happy with the layout and scalability looks good.

2010-04-15 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Optimised vkeyb drawing: when alpha is 0 it's no longer rendered.

2010-04-14 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Re-engineered the way the runtime options are set-up so that it's
  easier to modify. The hotspots though remain manually configured.
* The vkeyb state is now restored after accessing runtime options.
* Added key repeat delay and interval to the rcfile.
* Added sound volume to the rcfile.
* Added a runtime options icon to the control bar.
* Reorganised runtime option locations across pages.

2010-04-13 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added fg/bg colour adjustment to the runtime options.
* Fixed a bug in BMF_RenderText: the new fg_colour wasn't being stored.
* BMF_RenderText will now reuse the least requested slot if necessary.

2010-04-12 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added joystick dead zone adjustment to the runtime options.
* Added volume control adjustment to the runtime options.
* Added key repeat delay/interval adjustment to the runtime options.

2010-03-31 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Replaced the OSS (Open Sound System) API with the portable SDL API.

2010-03-24 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Version 2.1-5 released

2010-03-22 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Fixed an issue with the load selector changing the working directory
  and the GP2X's relatively referenced rcfile being written elsewhere.
* Added -d command line option to show any input device IDs on-screen.
* A sample joystick control set is written to newly created PC rcfiles.

2010-03-21 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added a protected property to ctrl_remaps to prevent modifying some
  important universally active controls such as toggle-keyboard.
* Tweaked the blinking selector speed.

2010-03-20 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Changed ZX80's vkeyb selected default to W for LOAD.
* Added the modifiable project colours to the rcfile.
* Added runtime joystick controls remapping feature to enable the
  remapping of existing controls allocated for use within the emulator
  (COMP_EMU) or new controls for use throughout the program (COMP_ALL).

2010-03-19 Chris Young <chris_at_unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk>
* Added RESOURCEFILE tooltype for Amiga build to configure where
  the rcfile is located (and the filename)

2010-03-18 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added an rcfile sz81rc which is located wherever the target platform
  requires it to be. Currently the joystick_dead_zone and the control
  remappings are written to and read from it but there'll be more.
  I've designed it so that the same macro names used in the code can
  be used within the configuration items.

2010-03-15 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* For some reason I had the GNU GPL v3 at the top of my sdl.c/h when
  I should have used the same v2 from z81. I've now fixed them.
* I've split the 3100+ line sdl.c up into several more organised files.

2010-03-14 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Vkeyb hotspots now have transparent corners, and their alpha's
  increase/decrease in relative units which means that they can still
  be seen when the vkeyb is almost invisible.
* Changed load selector selected default to Enter, and vkeyb to J.
* Fixed a situation whereby joystick fake-mouse button events and
  real mouse button events being both used to hit hotspots would leave
  a key unreleased. Admittedly this isn't going to happen under most
  situations and I found it through testing using multiple input
  devices, but now one joystick and one mouse can coexist together
  which is as many of these devices that this program is going to
  handle at any one time. Now it's possible (if such a game exists)
  for two players to use the same virtual keyboard - cool :D

2010-03-13 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added key repeating within the GUI for selected features.
* Adjusted the units of alpha used in the opacity DN/UP hotspots to
  16 since key repeating now makes this usable and more desirable.
 
2010-03-12 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Reworked the control remapping feature. Now a device can be
  remapped to any other device including a virtual cursor device, and
  be tied to a particular component such as the load selector.
* Added joystick support throughout. Joystick controls are currently
  hardcoded control remappings awaiting transferral to an rcfile.

2010-03-10 Chris Young <chris_at_unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk>
* Added version string for the AmigaOS4 build.
* Fixed AUTOLIST tooltype.

2010-03-09 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Appended z81's Makefile and docs with .z81 and added new files for
  our use since now sz81 is the main target.
* Reorganised some newly added files.
* Added a new sz81 specific Makefile and an AUTHORS file.

2010-03-08 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Version 2.1-4 released
* An SDL timer now manages timing if sound isn't being enabled from the
  command line or OSS_SOUND_SUPPORT is not enabled within the Makefile.

2010-03-05 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added some additional controls and reorganised them all.
* Shifted the ZX80 screen leftwards 2 chars since it causes problems
  with portrait orientated screens (is that a bug?).

2010-03-03 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added a control bar with several useful options that appear alongside
  the virtual keyboard.
* Added three Sinclair fonts, two for the control bar and the ZX
  Spectrum's for future use within the GUI.

2010-02-28 Chris Young <chris_at_unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk>
* Added code for the AmigaOS4 build.

2010-02-27 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Version 2.1-3 released
* Added virtual keyboard opacity adustment and autohide on newline;
  both currently modifiable via keyboard controls.

2010-02-25 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Hotspots now animate when pressed.

2010-02-23 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Hotspot engine for the mouse/stylus is now fully functional (although
  awaiting semi-opaque highlights) and SHIFT can be sticky or a toggle
  (a future runtime modifiable option).

2010-02-18 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Added a hotspot engine for virtual keyboard input.
* Added joystick support for all platforms.

2010-02-17 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Version 2.1-2 released
* Added new keyboard images.
* Emulator now centred regardless of resolution.

2010-02-14 Thunor <thunorsif_at_hotmail.com>
* Version 2.1-1 released - initial stable and fully functioning (except
  OSS sound) SDL port of z81.
