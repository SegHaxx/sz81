* big screen: 400x300 pixels (by default scaled 2).

- A nice resolution on modern displays may be obtained by
  specifying "-1200x900" on the command line.

- because of the screen size and the absence of borders,
  sometimes artefacts are seen (just as in EightyOne with Full Frame).

* Z80 core and pixel generation from EightyOne for proper timing.

  While the graphics possibilities are mostly retained in the code,
  only WRX is supported out-of-the box.

* Usually if hires is not ok, this is due to the maxireg setting in
  zx81/zx81.c; try for example 0x20 instead of 0x40.

* networking enabled with -n command line option.

* ASZMIC and SP ROM board compatibility:

- The easiest way to load the SP ROM is by loading "sp.p" in sz81.
  The RAM size should be 24K.
  With the command ". NEW" in the Virus, the ASZMIC is started.
  ASMZIC's "K" and "L" commands work with two data blocks - these are
  implemented using the ".a" and ".z" extensions - see the "./a2z"
  directory; for example, try: L "A2Z/A" <Enter>
  While versions 7 and the older 4 are supported, with version 4, the
  path separator '/' should be typed with '<' (a hack) due to the
  differences in the character set.
